I quote from the authoritative fourth edition of \' A cruising guide to the Maine Coast\' by Hank and Tan Taft and Curtis Rindlaub\\r\\n:\\r\\n\\r\\n\'Only 250 miles as the crow flies, Maine\'s convoluted coastline measures more than 3,500 miles. A new computerized study using satellite images has logged the length at a whopping 5,500 miles with 6,200 islands. By any count, there is enough coast here for a lifetime of cruising.\'\\r\\n\\r\\nMy Berwick is located in Rockland, Maine, on Penobscot Bay, which is considered the \'Midcoast\' .\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is what the guide has to say on it:\\r\\n\\r\\n\'Dream of perfect cruising grounds, of islands large and small, grand and modest, of intriguing harbours and alluring towns, of broad reaches and narrow tickles, of gritty fishing villages and sophisticated summer resorts, of lonely outposts lost in time. There is such a place, and the place is Penobscot Bay.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgainst the mountainous backdrop of the Camden Hills to the west, Penobscot Bay spreads 40 miles long and 15 miles wide, graced by more than 200 islands. Between them lies great stretches of open water and small, winding thouroughfaress. Along their shores are bustling fishing communities, quaint villages, isolated outports, and uninhabited beauty. This is the heart of cruising in Maine, and some of the best cruising in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe winds are generally moderate and predictable, and the dangers are well marked.....\'\\r\\n\\r\\nI also must mention that the tides average 9 feet!  not quite Jersey!  The sailing season spans from May through October. Also, Rockland is close to Portland, Maine, and Boston, Mass.\\r\\n\",\"annual_costs\":\"Summer is on owned mooring which is professionally maintained and inspected\\r\\nWinter on the hard at Rockland Harbour village\\r\\n\\u00a32000 for the whole boat per year - operating costs.\\r\\n\",\"are_you_selling_this_yacht_on_behalf_of_someone_else\":\"\",\"partner_1_details\":\"\",\"partner_2_details\":\"\",\"partner_3_details\":\"\",\"partner_4_details\":\"\",\"partner_5_details\":\"\",\"i_agree_to_yachtfractions_terms_and_conditions\":null}', NULL, 1347799668, 1357145428, '1', '0', '', 0, '1', 'NULL'),(32, 'Canigou', '2 cabin Bavaria 36 ', 'Sailing boat shares overseas', 'Mediterranean', 'Greece', 12, 9500, 0.2, 1, 5, '{\"teaser\":\"Preveza - Ionian - popular, well equipped cruising yacht with a double cabin aft and forward and 2 saloon berths.

She is very handy indeed off the wind. A Vega called Little My III crossed the Atlantic from the Cape Verde Islands to Barbados in 14 days, 16 hours. Richard Henderson, commenting on the trip in his book Singlehanded Sailing (International Marine), says: \\\"She reportedly surfed in the trade winds at speeds up to 13 knots, yet was dry, comfortable, and easily managed. Her excellent downwind behavior might be attributed to her well-balanced hull with flattish run, modest displacement, and moderately long full keel.\\\" In general she has a reputation for being extremely well behaved. She is easy to steer and stays under control even when hard pressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Full Review of Albin Vega\\r\\nRoyal Harwich Yacht Club\\r\\nThe Royal Harwich Yacht Club is situated in one of the most enviable positions on the East Coast. It is unique in providing unrivalled facilities on site within a stone\\u0092s throw of the Clubhouse \\u0096 Marina, Dinghy Park, Car Park and Launching facilities are all a short walk away, meaning that the Clubhouse really is the hub of all sailing activity at the RHYC. In addition, all members benefit from the nearby MDL Chandlery, our local boatbuilder, RHYC member Nigel Waller and other useful amenities to make sure you have everything you need to get sailing. \\r\\nThe views from the Clubhouse are stunning, downstream to Levington, and upstream towards the Orwell Bridge, offering a fabulous and relaxed environment to sail from. We are nestled in a sheltered pocket of sunny parkland where our expanse of lawn provides a perfect backdrop for lazy summer days, or after race barbeques.

She is extensively equipped for comfort, safety and enjoyable holidays. We have always tried to purchase good quality equipment and have installed a good battery charging regime and instruments. Juli is a comfortable holiday vessel &amp; that\'s why we chose her.  Most groups can cope with a week on a small boat but for a harmonious two week holiday, the extra space, equipment and comfort a motor sailer provides, makes the venture more relaxing. Her real strength is when two couples share the boat. The small double in the aft cabin is a bit cosy but avoids disturbing the main saloon to make up the saloon double berth.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe meet up when we can and staying together on Juli (even for a work week) gets everyone onside. You can discuss\\/ plan and leave with joint expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\nMembers make use of the vessel for their holidays and can invite family and friends of their choosing as crew. Good documentation aboard and members willing to assist smooth introduction of membership.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is worth mentioning the holiday rota - really in fifteen years this has never been a problem. 1st 2 week choice goes down the list. 2nd 2 week choice goes up the list. The following year, the person at the top of the list goes to the bottom everyone else moves up and repeat. That done, swaps often take place but no offence is taken if adjustments cannot be made (not sure if rare or never failed to resolve members hopes). We cope with sons and daughters &amp; grandchildren at school, university, weddings etc. never have been a problem. As August is often avoided for those without children (cheaper flights at other times) I cannot see  school holidays time as being a problem for those who require such periods but all existing members would need to have reached this understanding\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat the syndicate will be looking for in a new member is another like minded person with some boating experience (new members require insurance approval), common sense and with a natural caution of the sea. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe expect that a new member may need some help.
