NOTES FOR DAD:

Pretty much all images have are listed in the DB as "public_header" - there can only be one public_header image per yacht. I have added this validation but the images in the DB are still like that. The rest of the images need to be type="public_gallery" if they are to be displayed in the highslide gallery.

For the static front page url's 
	yacht/search/type/uk_yachts 		=> "Sailing boat shares UK"
	yacht/search/type/overseas_yachts 	=> "Sailing boat shares overseas"
	yacht/search/type/motor 			=> "Motor boat shares UK", "Motor boat shares O/S"
	yacht/search/type/brokerages 		=> "Used Yacht on brokerage"

Change the time for a yachtshare to be newly listed in:
	fuel/app/config/offline.php
