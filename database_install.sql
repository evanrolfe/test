There is such a place, and the place is Penobscot Bay.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgainst the mountainous backdrop of the Camden Hills to the west, Penobscot Bay spreads 40 miles long and 15 miles wide, graced by more than 200 islands. Between them lies great stretches of open water and small, winding thouroughfaress. Along their shores are bustling fishing communities, quaint villages, isolated outports, and uninhabited beauty. This is the heart of cruising in Maine, and some of the best cruising in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe winds are generally moderate and predictable, and the dangers are well marked.....''\\r\\n\\r\\nI also must mention that the tides average 9 feet!  not quite Jersey!

She is very handy indeed off the wind. A Vega called Little My III crossed the Atlantic from the Cape Verde Islands to Barbados in 14 days, 16 hours. Richard Henderson, commenting on the trip in his book Singlehanded Sailing (International Marine), says: \\"She reportedly surfed in the trade winds at speeds up to 13 knots, yet was dry, comfortable, and easily managed. Her excellent downwind behavior might be attributed to her well-balanced hull with flattish run, modest displacement, and moderately long full keel.\\" In general she has a reputation for being extremely well behaved.

In addition, all members benefit from the nearby MDL Chandlery, our local boatbuilder, RHYC member Nigel Waller and other useful amenities to make sure you have everything you need to get sailing. \\r\\nThe views from the Clubhouse are stunning, downstream to Levington, and upstream towards the Orwell Bridge, offering a fabulous and relaxed environment to sail from.
